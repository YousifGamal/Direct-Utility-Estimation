Needed ilbrary: Numpy

command to run:
python req5.py x y
-x is either a or b or c (the 3 different worlds as mentioned in the problme)
-y is integer for number of iterartions
e-xample to run 3 * 4 world with 1000 iterations:  python req5.py a 1000

Output: two text files of the result
-"Tabular Form.txt" for the tabular form method
-"Function Approximation.txt" for the function approximation method

World policies are fixed in the code
